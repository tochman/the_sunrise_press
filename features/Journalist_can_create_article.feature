            | Bill | bill@email.com | password | password              | journalist |

        And the following category exists:
            | name    |
            | Sport   |
            | Weather |
        And I am logged in as 'bill@email.com'
        And I click on 'New article'

    Scenario: Journalist can create article
        Given I fill in 'Title' field with 'My article'
        And I fill in 'Description' field with 'This is a description'
        And I fill in 'Content' field with 'This is my article about the sunny weather'
        And I select 'Weather' from 'Category'
